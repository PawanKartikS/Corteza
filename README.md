### Corteza

Corteza is a platform that analyzes a person's social media profile and assesses a person's mental condition which includes, but not limited to:

  (a) Extreme mood swings
  
  (b) Negative/Suicidal thoughts
  
Corteza analyzes both posts and images and outputs a report containing a graph. Posts and images from a user's profile are analyzed and given a score between 0 and 1. Values nearer to 0 are un-favourable while those nearer to 1 are favourable. A graph of these values is contained in the report which offers very brief insight into a person's profile. Posts having significant difference in scores are marked and keywords picked, which are shown at the end.

This analysis allows a user to identify how they react / respond to a particular story or a topic. Also, the very same analysis allows the user to identify the pattern in which they exhibit their emotions (or change of emotions) on social media sites.

### Data Collection Policy

Images from a person’s profile are not downloaded to the local disk, but securely redirected to the cloud for analysis. However, we are in the process of switching to a local CNN model for which the user’s photos maybe downloaded and stored locally for a short period.
 
Posts and tweets are downloaded and stored locally for more comprehensive analysis. Measures are being put in place to ensure that any confidential data (Phone number, Unique ID issued by the Govt etc.) is erased.
 
User must provide the access to the profile every time an analysis is to be run. User can view the date and time of access via the social site’s activity panel / dashboard and if necessary, can revoke the authorization and block any future analysis.
